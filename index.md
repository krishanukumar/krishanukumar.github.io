## Research

My research expertise lies in experimental fluid mechanics, with a particular emphasis on multiphase flows. During my doctoral work at Tel Aviv University and now in my postdoctoral research at the University of Michigan, my focus has been on two-phase flows, particularly air–water interactions in controlled laboratory settings.

As a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Erinin Research Group](https://erinin.engin.umich.edu/) at the **University of Michigan**, I am currently studying droplet generation and dynamics in wave-breaking, both in the presence and absence of mean wind flow.

### Effect of mean flow profile in-air and in-water on the growth rate of young wind-waves

The generation and growth of wind waves are re-examined using linear viscous shear flow instability theory by solving the coupled in-air and in-water Orr-Sommerfeld (OS) equations. To enable comparison with the available laboratory observations, model simulations are performed for a wide range of wavelengths spanning the gravity-capillary and gravity wave regimes typical of such experiments.

### Wind-waves in the presence of a mean water current

The spatial evolution of various statistical parameters of fetch-limited waves generated by steadily blowing wind over mean water flow in a wind-wave flume is investigated experimentally.

### On the direct measurement of growth rates of fetch-limited wind-waves

The present laboratory study accounts for multiple co-existing statistically stationary random frequency harmonics. Single-point synchronous measurements of the instantaneous surface elevation and of its along-wind slope component are performed by optical methods at numerous locations. Assuming exponential spatial growth, the phase shift between the surface elevation and surface slope at each frequency is related to the spatial growth rate of each harmonic.

### Droplet generation in rotating disk atomization

Film formation, disintegration, and drop formation mechanisms in the rotating disk atomization process for slig were modeled using a computational fluid dynamics-based approach. Droplet solidification process and phase transitions at a variable cooling rate for BF Slag were also analysed.
