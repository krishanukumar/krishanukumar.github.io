## Research

My research expertise lies in experimental fluid mechanics, with a particular focus on multiphase flows. In my doctoral and postdoctoral work at Tel Aviv University and the University of Michigan, I have focused on two-phase flows, with particular emphasis on the air-water interaction in laboratory settings.

As a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Erinin Research Group](https://erinin.engin.umich.edu/) at the **University of Michigan**, I primarily work on studying droplet generation and evolution due to wave-breaking events in the wavfield in the presence and absence of mean wind flow.
