## Research

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Erinin Research Group](https://erinin.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, where my research focuses on droplet dynamics generated by various wave-breaking mechanisms, both with and without wind forcing.

During my PhD, I carried out experiments in a wind–wave flume to study the excitation, interaction, and evolution of non-linear wind waves in the presence of the mean water current; to develop a quasi-linear model and to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms behind wind–wave excitation and spatio-temporal growth.
