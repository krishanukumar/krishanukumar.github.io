## Research

My research expertise lies in experimental fluid mechanics, with a particular emphasis on multiphase flows. During my doctoral work at Tel Aviv University and now in my postdoctoral research at the University of Michigan, my focus has been on two-phase flows, particularly airâ€“water interactions in controlled laboratory settings.

As a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Erinin Research Group](https://erinin.engin.umich.edu/) at the **University of Michigan**, I study droplet generation and evolution resulting from wave-breaking events, both in the presence and absence of mean wind flow.
