## About me


I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, working under Prof. Martin Erinin. My research focuses on wave breaking dynamics, droplet formation, and sea spray generation.

I earned my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Tel Aviv University, Israel, investigating the excitation, interaction, and evolution of non-linear random wind waves in the presence of mean water current under Prof. Lev Shemer. Additionally, I worked on the evolution of wind waves in a circular pipe under Prof. Lev Shemer and Prof. Dvora Barnea.

CFD enthusiast with experience in multi-phase flow (droplet formation mechanism, solidification),  microfluidics, external flow over an airfoil with plasma modeling, and optimization using a multi-objective genetic algorithm.
