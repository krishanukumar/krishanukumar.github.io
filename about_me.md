## About me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the **Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan**, working in the [Erinin Research Group](https://erinin.engin.umich.edu/). My research focuses on wave breaking dynamics, droplet formation, and sea spray generation.

I earned my PhD in **Mechanical Engineering from Tel Aviv University**, where I studied the excitation, interaction, and evolution of non-linear random wind waves in the presence of a mean water current under [Prof. Lev Shemer](https://levshemer.sites.tau.ac.il/). 

In addition, I investigated the evolution and characteristics of different flow patterns in a circular pipe for steady gas-liquid flow under Prof. Lev Shemer and Prof. Dvora Barnea.

Prior to my PhD, I worked on numerical simulations of centrifugal atomization to estimate powder size distribution, incorporating phase change into the model. The numerical results were validated against experiments conducted using high-speed imaging. This work was carried out under the supervision of [Prof. Sabita Sarkar](https://sites.google.com/smail.iitm.ac.in/sabita) at the **Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, IIT Madras**.
