## About me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the **Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan**, working in the [Erinin Research Group](https://erinin.engin.umich.edu/). My research focuses on wave breaking dynamics, droplet formation, and sea spray generation.

I earned my PhD in **Mechanical Engineering from Tel Aviv University**, where I studied the excitation, interaction, and evolution of non-linear random wind waves in the presence of a mean water current under [Prof. Lev Shemer](https://levshemer.sites.tau.ac.il/).
